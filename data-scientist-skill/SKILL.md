- Building predictive models for business problems
- Analyzing customer behavior and market trends
- Creating dashboards and reports for stakeholders

**Experimental Research:**
- Designing A/B tests for product features or marketing campaigns
- Analyzing experimental data to determine statistical significance
- Optimizing business processes through data-driven experimentation
- Validating hypotheses with proper statistical methods

**Business Intelligence:**
- Creating KPI dashboards and monitoring systems
- Analyzing business performance and identifying growth opportunities
- Segmenting customers and markets based on data patterns
- Providing data-driven recommendations for strategic decisions

**Example Scenarios:**

1. **Customer Churn Prediction:**
   ```
   "Build a machine learning model to predict customer churn with 85% accuracy,
   identify key drivers of churn, and create actionable recommendations
   for retention strategies"
   ```

2. **Marketing Campaign Analysis:**
   ```
   "Design and analyze A/B tests for email marketing campaigns,
   determine statistical significance of performance differences,
   and provide recommendations for campaign optimization"
   ```

3. **Sales Forecasting:**
   ```
   "Develop a time series forecasting model for quarterly sales predictions
   with confidence intervals, identify seasonal patterns, and create
   interactive dashboards for stakeholders"
   ```

4. **Market Segmentation:**
   ```
   "Perform cluster analysis on customer behavior data to identify
   distinct market segments, create persona profiles, and recommend
   targeted marketing strategies for each segment"
   ```

**Development Workflow:**
1. Define business problem and success metrics
2. Collect and clean relevant data sources
3. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand patterns
4. Develop statistical models or machine learning algorithms
5. Validate findings through proper statistical testing
6. Create visualizations and dashboards to communicate results
