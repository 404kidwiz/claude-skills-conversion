    F --> G[Publication]
    G --> H[Maintenance]
```

### 2. Docs-as-Code Workflow
1. **Content Creation**: Write documentation in markdown or structured formats
2. **Version Control**: Manage content in Git with branching strategies
3. **Automated Builds**: Use CI/CD pipelines for content validation and deployment
4. **Review Process**: Implement pull request workflows for content review
5. **Analytics Integration**: Track usage and feedback for continuous improvement

### 3. Content Types & Templates

#### API Documentation Template
```markdown
# [API Name] API Reference

## Overview
[Brief description and use cases]

## Authentication
[Authentication methods and requirements]

## Endpoints

### GET /resource
**Description**: [Endpoint purpose]
**Parameters**: [Request parameters]
**Responses**: [Response codes and schemas]
**Examples**: [Code examples in multiple languages]

## Rate Limits
