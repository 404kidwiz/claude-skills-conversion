   "Build an intent classification system using BERT that categorizes
   customer support tickets with 92% accuracy and routes them
   to appropriate departments automatically"
   ```

2. **Document Analysis Platform:**
   ```
   "Develop a document understanding pipeline that extracts
   entities, relationships, and key information from legal
   documents with human-level accuracy and confidence scores"
   ```

3. **Multilingual Sentiment Analysis:**
   ```
   "Create a sentiment analysis system supporting 10 languages
   using multilingual transformers, with domain adaptation
   for social media text and real-time processing capabilities"
   ```
