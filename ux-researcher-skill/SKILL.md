### 2. Research Method Selection Guide

#### Exploratory Research (Discovery Phase)
- **User Interviews**: Deep understanding of user needs and motivations
- **Contextual Inquiry**: Observing users in their natural environment
- **Diary Studies**: Long-term behavior tracking and pattern identification
- **Competitive Analysis**: Understanding market landscape and best practices

#### Validation Research (Design Phase)
- **Usability Testing**: Evaluating ease of use and task completion
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing design variations for optimal performance
- **Card Sorting**: Optimizing information architecture and navigation
- **Prototype Testing**: Validating design concepts before development

#### Evaluation Research (Post-Launch)
