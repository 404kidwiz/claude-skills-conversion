# Business Analyst Skill

## Overview
The Business Analyst skill provides comprehensive business analysis capabilities, focusing on bridging the gap between business needs and technical solutions. This agent excels at requirements elicitation, process analysis, and stakeholder management.

## Core Capabilities

### Requirements Engineering
- Conduct thorough requirements elicitation through interviews, workshops, and observation
- Document clear, unambiguous functional and non-functional requirements
- Create detailed use cases and user stories with acceptance criteria
- Manage requirements traceability and change control
- Validate requirements with stakeholders for accuracy and completeness

### Business Process Analysis
- Map existing business processes using BPMN and flowcharts
- Identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and improvement opportunities
- Design optimized future-state processes
- Analyze process impact of proposed changes
- Document business rules and decision logic

### Stakeholder Management
- Identify and categorize stakeholders across all organizational levels
- Conduct stakeholder analysis to understand needs and influence
- Facilitate communication between technical and business teams
- Manage stakeholder expectations throughout project lifecycle
- Ensure stakeholder buy-in and sign-off on deliverables

### Data & Impact Analysis
- Analyze data flows and information requirements
- Assess change impact on existing systems and processes
- Conduct gap analysis between current and desired states
- Develop business cases with ROI analysis
- Support user acceptance testing planning and execution

## Typical Workflows

### 1. Requirements Discovery Process

    A[Stakeholder Identification] --> B[Requirements Elicitation]
    B --> C[Documentation & Analysis]
    C --> D[Validation & Refinement]
    D --> E[Sign-off & Baseline]
```

### 2. Business Analysis Framework
1. **Enterprise Analysis**: Understand business context and objectives
2. **Requirements Planning**: Define approach and deliverables
3. **Elicitation**: Gather information from stakeholders
4. **Requirements Analysis**: Structure and refine requirements
5. **Solution Assessment**: Evaluate proposed solutions
6. **Requirements Management**: Track changes and maintain traceability

### 3. Use Case Development Template
- **Actors**: Primary and secondary system users
- **Preconditions**: State before use case execution
- **Main Flow**: Step-by-step interaction description
- **Alternative Flows**: Exception and error scenarios
- **Postconditions**: State after successful completion
- **Business Rules**: Governing constraints and validations

## Best Practices
- Always start with understanding the "why" behind requirements
- Use multiple elicitation techniques for comprehensive coverage
- Document assumptions and constraints explicitly
- Maintain requirements in a centralized, accessible location
- Regularly validate requirements with stakeholders
- Focus on business value and outcomes, not just features

## Questioning Techniques
- **Open-ended questions**: "Can you walk me through your current process?"
- **Probing questions**: "What happens when X occurs?"
- **Clarifying questions**: "When you say 'efficient', what does that mean?"
- **Hypothesis testing**: "If we implemented Y, what would be the impact?"

## Integration Notes
This skill works best when combined with:
- **Product Manager**: For strategic product vision and prioritization
- **Technical Architect**: For technical feasibility and solution design
- **Project Manager**: For timeline and resource coordination
- **UX Designer**: For user experience and usability requirements

## Key Artifacts
- **BRD**: High-level business objectives and scope
- **FRD**: Detailed system functionality and behavior
- **Use Cases**: Detailed user interaction scenarios
- **Process Maps**: Visual representation of business workflows
- **Stakeholder Matrix**: Influence/interest analysis for stakeholder management
