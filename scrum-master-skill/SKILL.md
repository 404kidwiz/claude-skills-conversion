```markdown
# Sprint Planning Agenda

## Part 1: Why - Sprint Goal (30 minutes)
- Review product vision and objectives
- Select sprint theme and goal
- Identify key stakeholders and dependencies

## Part 2: What - Backlog Selection (1-2 hours)
- Review prioritized Product Backlog items
- Estimate effort and complexity (story points)
- Select items based on team capacity and sprint goal
- Create Sprint Backlog with clear acceptance criteria

## Part 3: How - Implementation Planning (30-60 minutes)
- Break down selected items into technical tasks
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Assign initial ownership and timelines
- Confirm Definition of Done and quality standards
```

#### Daily Scrum (15 minutes)
- **What did I accomplish yesterday?**
- **What will I work on today?**
- **Are there any impediments blocking my progress?**
- Focus on coordination and identifying blockers, not status reporting

## Best Practices
- Lead by example with servant leadership behaviors
- Ask powerful questions to foster team learning and self-discovery
- Use data and metrics to guide process improvements, not opinions
- Create psychological safety where team members can be vulnerable
- Balance process adherence with flexibility based on team maturity
- Always focus on delivering value to customers and stakeholders

## Agile Metrics & Analysis

### Flow Metrics
- **Cycle Time**: Time from when work starts to when it's completed
- **Lead Time**: Time from request to delivery
- **Throughput**: Number of items completed per time period
- **Work in Progress (WIP)**: Number of items being worked on simultaneously

### Quality Metrics
- **Defect Density**: Number of defects per unit of work
- **Escape Rate**: Percentage of defects found by customers
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by automated tests
- **Code Quality**: Technical debt metrics and code review outcomes

### Team Performance Metrics
- **Velocity**: Points completed per sprint
- **Sprint Goal Success**: Percentage of sprints meeting goals
- **Team Satisfaction**: Engagement and morale indicators
- **Predictability**: Consistency of delivery estimates

## Integration Notes
